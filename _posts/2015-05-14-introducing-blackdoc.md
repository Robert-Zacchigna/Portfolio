title: Introducing BlackDoc
---

BlackDoc is a two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} theme that's ideal for websites that require a 
master-detail layout for viewing of content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com){:target="_blank"}, the Jekyll butler, and the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com){:target="_blank"} theme.

I needed a two-column layout with a scrolling sidebar to publish and display my various [data science projects](https://github.com/Robert-Zacchigna/DSC-680_Portfolio){:target="_blank"}, 
and found the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) Jekyll theme to be a good starting theme. I customised the theme to make 
it look great in black background and changed the sidebar to display scrolling content. I created this theme because 
I can't seem to find any good Jekyll theme with a master-detail layout. Hopefully, someone will find this useful as well in their own projects.

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as a foundation for creating Jekyll themes. Poole-based themes, such as BlackDoc here, include the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/404">404</a>{:target="_blank"},
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atom.xml">RSS Feed</a>{:target="_blank"}, posts, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about">example page</a>{:target="_blank"})
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting using Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### BlackDoc Features

In addition to the features of [Poole](http://getpoole.com){:target="_blank"} and [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com){:target="_blank"}, BlackDoc theme adds the following:

* Scrolling sidebar with a thin scrollbar to allow displaying of numerous top-level content.
* Elements and classes of the Hyde theme were updated to look great in black background. Check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}styles">Theme Styles</a>{:target="_blank"} to see the stylings used in the theme.

Check out the `Readme` of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole){:target="_blank"} and [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde){:target="_blank"} theme to learn more about the features.

### Browser support

BlackDoc theme supports most modern browsers and only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

BlackDoc is a free Jekyll theme and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="{{ site.github.repo }}/zipball/BlackDoc-Local">GitHub repository</a> to download.

Cheers!
