</div>

My name is [Robert Zacchigna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-zacchigna){:target="_blank"} and welcome to my little corner 
of the web containing my various data science'y projects that I have worked or in the process of working on.

On the left-hand side of the page you will see a sidebar that lists all the projects I have worked on and published. Feel 
free to browse around and take a look, there is quite the variety of content to view.

I graduated from [Illinois State University](https://illinoisstate.edu/ "Go Redbirds!"){:target="_blank"} in 2019 and not long after started working as a Data Engineer at my current employer: 
[Discover Financial Services](https://www.discover.com/company/){:target="_blank"} (going on almost 2.5 years of service).
During my time at Discover, I was actually able to pursue a Masters in Data Science and find my passion for [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science){:target="_blank"} 
and [Data Engineering](https://www.springboard.com/library/data-engineering/job-description/){:target="_blank"} thanks to 
their employee advancement program (which only further cemented my love for [Python](https://www.python.org/about/ "Hail the Almighty Snake!"){:target="_blank"}).

I have since graduated from [Bellevue University](https://www.bellevue.edu/){:target="_blank"} (2021) with a Masters in 
Data Science and continue to develop my analytical skills through the various projects that I pursue, see sidebar to the left.

## Interested in Data Science?

If you are interested in taking a closer look at what Data Science is, here are some resources that I have collected in my journey thus far:

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/){:target="_blank"} (Datasets)
  * THE place to go for pretty much any type of dataset you can think of with all the relevant information needed that comes with it.
